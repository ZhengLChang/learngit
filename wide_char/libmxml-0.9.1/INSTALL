Under posix compliant systems, a
   ./configure
   make
   make install

should be enough. Remember to set prefix for configure to a suitable path:

   ./configure --prefix=/my/favourites/libs

the lib will be installed under the /lib dir of the "prefix".


To install from CVS do
   aclocal
   automake -a
   autoconf


before doing other install steps. "automake -a" is important, as it will
create the standard GNU support utilities to do a clean configure/make
process.


To enable debuging symbols add --enable-debug, and to make also tests
(linked against static library) do --enable-tests.

Dynamic libraries can be built by passing --enabled-shared to configure
